Debugging can be done in different ways. Two of them are,
	  Static debugging
	  Dynamic debugging
Static Debugging
	Analysing the code for errors and possible mistakes even before compiling is called as static debugging.

Dynamic debugging
	Debugging at run time using debugging hardware such as JTAG is called dynamic debugging.
