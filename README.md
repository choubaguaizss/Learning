This is just for some learning.
Hi,

welcome, So you are interested, sounds great...
Just edit this file and put down your ideas starting with your name, (eg, madhiyan: this is my idea.)
Satheesh if you see this the idea can also be something related to electromotive, but doable by bunch of idiots.

Madhiyan: I always wish I could have a wireless lock for my room, as in the movie "The amazing spider man". We can also expand this idea to so so sos so many things. I would propose zigbee tecnology, people are very much interested in zigbee for home automation.
